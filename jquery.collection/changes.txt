1.0.4
[Change]
- Relicensed to MIT+GPL.
[Ã’ptimization]
- the function 'extend' was being added twice to $.collection.fn (one with extend, and one with include).
[Fix]
- instanceof is not used anymore, caused memory leaks in IE, kudos to vOGRe.

1.0.3
[Fix]
- pushStack might have failed in some cases.

1.0.2
[Fix]
- Small fix for pushStack

1.0.1
- The static methods, copied from $.collection to its subclasses, have been exposed as $.collection.statics.
	This is a string which by now is 'extend,build,include,implement'. New methods can be concatenated.
	If desired, one could add the line $.collection.statics = $.collection.statics.split(',') and use it as an array.
- As implied in the previous item, $.collection got a new function called 'implement'.
- The comma separated method names given to the function include(), can have spaces near the commas, now.
- Converted the README into a humble API.
- Removed queue and dequeue, they don't seem to work reliably.

1.0.0
- First release, check the README to see the features.
