1.0.3
[Feature]
- Added an exprimental option, Indexer.fn.cache() and $.listen.cache( true/false ).
- Added support for comma separated selectors
[Optimization]
- Got more obsessive with cleanup to avoid memory leaks.

1.0.2
[Feature]
- If the handlers return false, e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation() are called.
- Stopping the propagation also stops forced bubbling.

1.0.1
[Fix]
- If the indexer was set to bubble, it would bubble up the document, instead of to its listener.

1.0.0
[Feature]
- Added Jorn's approach of focusin/focusout. You can now safely listen for blur and focus events.
- Added $.fn.indexer( event_name ) to get access to the indexer of the first matched element.
- $.listen.fixes is a hash that maps event/fixedEvent. If you add a fix at $.event.special, add it to this hash and it will work automatically.
- It's possible to instruct indexers to emulate the natural bubbling like this: $(..).indexer( ... ).bubbles = true, use with discretion, will hit on perfomance.
- Added support for multiple events separated with spaces.
[Optimization]
- Reduced the code size, this release (with all its features) is smaller than the previous one.
- Added many optimizations for minified code size.
- Improved the cleaning done on window.onload to avoid memory leaks.
[Change]
- $.listen is not used for stopping/restarting the indexers, use $.fn.indexer( ... ).(start|stop)() instead.
- Changed the licensing from GPL to GPL+MIT.
[Fix]
- The [].splice.call(arguments,..) wasn't working in Opera.
