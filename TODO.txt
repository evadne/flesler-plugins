Broadcast & Tasks
- RELEASE IT!

XHR and AjaxFilter
- Announce them on the blog

GENERAL
- Fix uses of nodeName as it won't work on xml+xhtml (Preload and Listen surely have)

SerialScroll
- The event goto can accept a DOMElement (an item).
- Let the 'this' of the callbacks be the settings object.
- Thus make each instance of the plugin have a clone of the settings.
- Snippet to highlight the active link.

FastTrigger
- Forgot 'shiftKey' in the fake event (is this neccessary?) nah!

Listen
- nodeName.toUpperCase() so it works with application/xhtml+xml
