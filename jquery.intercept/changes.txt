1.1.2
[Change]
- The scope(this) is the element that triggered the event again.
[Feature]
- Added support for absolute selectors ( parent child > descendant + .class )

1.1.1
- The hash wasn't being cloned, that's an error.
- Added support for whitespace separated events.
- Now the handler is at $.intercept.handle.
- $.intercept accepts the same arguments but intercepts globally( using <html> ). No need to wait for document ready.

1.1.0
 -Added semicolon to the start, for safe file concatenation
 -Changed license from GPL to GPL+MIT
 -This release is compatible with jQuery 1.2.x.
 -Removed the option 'delegate'. Seemed confusing.
 -Made the code much simpler and shorter.
 -Exposed the handler as $.intercept so it can be unbound.
 -If a handler returns false, that will stop the event (like with regular handlers)
 -Added a 3 arguments overload $(...).intercept( event, selector, handler );
 -The scope(this) of the handlers is the intercepter and no longer the interceptee, use e.target instead.

1.0.2
- new 'delegate' option.
- the selector 'self' now is checked in the order it is added.
